# Planets Facts

## Overview
Project inspired in the challenge of FrontEnd Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f). This project use a external API (https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/en/) to get the planet facts (unlike the original project that has local files in .json format to obtain the planet facts).

## The challenge

> Planets fact site
>
> Your challenge is to build out this 8-page planets fact site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
>
> You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
>
>If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local data.json file for the planets. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate .html files.
>
>Your users should be able to:
>
>* View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
>* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
>* View each planet page and toggle between the "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology" tabs
>
>Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
